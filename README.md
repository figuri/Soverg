  ## Usage
  This app runs in the terminal. Once you finish installing; open the terminal and navigate to the cloned repository. Run the command `node index.js` to start the app. Follow the prompts to generate your svg file. Once you finish asnwering the questions the app will ask you ("text content?", "color of text?","shape{circle, square or triangle}", "color of shape") then the app will generate a file called
  "logo.svg" in the root directory of the repository. The image will also load in your browser. open the app in a text editor or acces the director in a file explorer to see the files location.

  ## Tests
 This Svg generator app is equipped with a node module called jest. With jest I created a file that will allow a user to test the functionality of the app before use. Simply run :    npm test

 WARNING: this will run the test file and will not generate a svg file. To generate a svg file run the command: node index.js

 additionally, make sure to run "npm install jest" if you are thrown an error that says module not found.
